# Example Deploy Command
This code has been stripped down from what we actually use. There is hopefully just enough code and comments to get an idea how it works. This code uses a Rolling Deploy type of pattern. This means we take out sections of nodes from a load balancer, deploy the app, bring it up healthy, add them back into the load balancer and then move on to the next section. We will kick out at any point that a health check fails. Typically if an app will fail it's health check, it will fail in the first section. This gives us a `safe to fail` stance as dropping a 1/4 of our nodes is ok. If you have the resources or are working against a PaaS, you could do a `blue\green` deployment. This is when you deploy your app to a second set of nodes, bring them all up healthy and then insta switch the traffic over to the new set of nodes.

Note that this task does not talk about database schema updates. We do that in a prior step. This also means that all our database migrations are backwards compatible as there will be sometime where old code will run against new database changes.
