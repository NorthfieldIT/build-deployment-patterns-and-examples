# Example Code
You can find example code of a basic start to build and deployment scripts (The Northfield.Scripts directory) and jenkins templating (jenkins-dsl-example). We've also included an example chef recipe (random-jenkins-chef-recipe) as an example "deployable" to give extra context for the build scripts and jenkins dsl.
