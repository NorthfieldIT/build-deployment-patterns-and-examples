This is an example Chef Recipe that is being used to demo the build scripts and jenkins dsl. You will notice there is a "buildscripts" directory that contains configurations for buildscripts. It contains the "app_name" for this repo and configurations for rubocop and foodcritic. Rakefile.rb contains the core steps for the "build" and "deploy" jobs.
